### Hi there :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm Elena Komarova and I'm a QA Automation engineer.

- I had been working as a manual QA engineer since 2014. 
- Since 2020 I've started work with autotests on Java. 
- Since the middle of 2021 to the end of 2022 I was the full stack QA.

As you can see, there are a lot of qa guru homeworks projects. The reason is simple - Iâ€™m studying QA automation in qa.guru school. And now I'm interested in improving my skills in this scope.
